Evaluate performance metrics for calls and chats (completion, failure, and dropout rates).

Assess customer satisfaction using rating distributions.

Identify top-performing gurus and improvement areas for others.

Recommend strategic actions to optimize resources, improve customer experience, and boost platform efficiency.
